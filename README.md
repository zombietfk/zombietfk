# ZOMBIE+TFK


I am a British/American web/game/embedded/whatsit/gizo/whatever developer (Not strictly in that order) who *mainly* makes games in my spare time

I've been doing this for a long time, and my hope is in another decade of doing this to maybe get an idea of what exactly I'm doing! ;)

- 6+ years professional web dev experience with a focus on backend - primarilly with Java Spring(+Spring Boot), PHP Laravel, and NodeJS
- 4+ years professional web dev experience with a focus on frontend - Including with React, jQuery, Semantic UI, Bootstrap... Honestly way too many to track!
- 2 years native app development experience - particularly for Android but also including multiplatform development using React-Native
- Plenty of amatuer experience with C/C++, especially using SDL2, but lots of other tech too! As well as game development experience with Unity using C# and most recently with Godot using GDSCript!

Currently my biggest focus is with using Godot to make fun games in my spare time. Check out my projects and I hope you all find them amusing if not entertaining or even perhaps enlightening!

Thank you for visiting my profile <3 Please follow me or fork / star my repos and reach out any time!
